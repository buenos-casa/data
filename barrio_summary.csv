0,PALERMO,"A trendy area, jam-packed with shops, restaurants and bars that are ideal for today’s jetsetters.",,
1,BELGRANO,"It’s near Rio de la Plata with access to football clubs, tennis and recreation areas. It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, with charming boutiques, fruit stands, restaurants and bars. Owing to its affluence, Belgrano is also popular for shopping. Avenida Cabildo runs the entire width of the barrio and is lined with a huge quantity of clothing and shoe shops ranging from chain stores to independent boutiques","Affluent, Popular",
2,NUÑEZ,"Nuñez is a relaxed residential neighborhood popular with families with young children and professional couples. Boasting a good mix of contemporary apartment blocks, commercial streets and residential homes, Nuñez bears a similar resemblance to the northern suburbs.",Good transport system,
3,VILLA ORTUZAR,,,
4,BALVANERA,"In addition to offering a plethora of hotels, hostels and residential accommodation, the barrio has excellent transport links thus within easy reach of the city’s coveted attractions and nightlife hotspots of Palermo and San Telmo. Balvanera offers a fusion of working class areas (some noticeably a little rough around the edges), bohemian lifestyle and entertainment.",,
5,SAN CRISTOBAL,"These days, San Cristóbal is a barrio that, like parts of neighboring Balvanera, goes about its business with little fuss and is characterized by trade and industry.",,
6,VILLA CRESPO,"Villa Crespo was also sometimes referred to as Palermo Queens around 2007. Palermo is considered a more expensive neighborhood and renaming Villa Crespo as part of Palermo would allow people to charge higher rents, etc. Villa Crespo has been informally associated with Buenos Aires’ Jewish community, with several synagogues located in the barrio. Recently Villa Crespo has started to attract a younger crowd of artistic types, who have given the barrio a distinctly cool edge.",,
7,VILLA GENERAL MITRE,,,
8,FLORESTA,,,
9,PARQUE CHACABUCO,"As it is less popular with tourists and expats, you’ll certainly be able to find some cheaper rents in Parque Chacabuco. Be prepared, however, for a working class neighborhood and nothing like the more Europeanized areas of Palermo.",,
10,PARQUE AVELLANEDA,,,
11,CABALLITO,"You’ll see a quite neighborhood (except for when families pick up or drop off kids at school), where some good old cafes managed to survive next to new cuisines and the Starbucks of the world. You will also find young people in the area, expats and locals, partly because of “Filo” (or “Puan”), one of the University of Buenos Aires buildings. For those who plan to stay a long time in Buenos Aires, the primary attraction of Caballito is that it’s a whole lot cheaper than places like Palermo, very comfortable, has some character, and yet isn’t too far from the action. It’s great value for money",,
12,ALMAGRO,Almagro is between Avenidas Indepencia and Cordoba and dissected by Avenida Rivadavia – one of the city’s main thoroughfares – and has an active commercial district as well as a high population density.. Middle class.,,
13,POMPEYA,,,
14,VILLA URQUIZA, Villa Urquiza occupies a quieter zone of Buenos Aires with a blend of town houses and modern apartment blocks. If you pass by at the weekend you might just spot locals sweeping the leaves outside their homes and sharing a mate whilst chatting to their neighbors.,,
15,SAAVEDRA,"Being predominately a residential barrio, Saavedra offers a pleasant respite from Microcentro and the popular tourist barrios. Moreover, in Parque Sarmiento it has one of the largest recreational venues in the city.",,
16,VILLA PUEYRREDON,,,
17,VILLA LURO,,,
18,MATADEROS,"There is no better example of working country life within the city confines than Mataderos and when visiting the barrio you will be rewarded with a wonderful insight into how different the city is from the bustle of El Centro and the heavily touristic barrios of Palermo and San Telmo.

Great for a visit and to enjoy the spirit of the weekend market, as Mataderos is a solid one-hour bus ride from the main action of the city it is unlikely that you would want to live here for the long-term.",,
19,FLORES,"As it started life as a town in its own right, Flores, with its residential areas, commercial shopping district, nightlife and football club, has just about everything you can ask for and you’ll probably be able to find far cheaper rents than in the barrios further north. The A line of the Subte also stops in the barrio and provides fast access direct to Plaza de Mayo. Close to a slum.",,
20,VERSAILLES,,,
21,LINIERS,,,
22,VELEZ SARFIELD,,,
23,VILLA DEVOTO,"It is also the home of the infamously overcrowded Devoto Prison, the only working prison within the boundaries of Buenos Aires City and in 1978 the scene of the worst prison riot in Argentine history",,
24,BOCA,"Boca was first the center for immigrants, but now it has made a name for itself with colorful buildings highlighted by tango singers and dancers that flock its vibrant streets. rough, working class and downbeat neighborhood, despites the hordes of tourists who descend upon its attractions every weekend and most weekdays too",,
25,AGRONOMIA,"For those that have a desire to visit a sleepy neighborhood then Agronomía is far removed from commercialism of the ‘cooler’ Buenos Aires barrios. Resembling a spider’s web, there are three-to-four circling streets complete with crisscrossing counterparts which, for the geographically-challenged, can make getting confused a simple thing. Moreover, the circling streets and those leading off them are curiously named after major European cities; Constantinople, La Haya (The Hague) and Sofia, amongst others.",,
26,CHACARITA,"Being just outside of the common Buenos Aires tourist trail, a big plus of staying in Chacarita is its affordability. With the Urquiza and San Martin train lines, and B line of the Subte all running to/from Estacion Federico Lacroze, the barrio is also well connected to the city center and northern suburbs.",,
27,PATERNAL,,,
28,COLEGIALES,"Colegiales maintains a strong residential feel that is characterized by its sleepy cobblestoned avenues lined with overhanging trees. That said, due to its close proximity to Palermo, the neighborhood is witnessing a rise in bars and restaurants",,
29,VILLA DEL PARQUE,,,
30,VILLA LUGANO,,,
31,VILLA SANTA RITA,,,
32,BARRACAS,"The yellow fever epidemic caused the wealthy residents of Barracas to flee to the northern areas of the city. Just as happened in neighboring San Telmo, the flight of wealthier families from Barracas turned it overnight into a working-class area and provided space for immigrants, particularly from Italy, to find homes there. It has remained a modest, working-class suburb ever since.","Working class, residential",
33,MONTE CASTRO,,,
34,VILLA RIACHUELO,,,
35,RETIRO,This is also a hub for lovely restaurants and bars since many ex-pats adore this neighborhood.,,
36,MONTSERRAT,"As the financial district and the downtown of Buenos Aires, Microcentro is surrounded by historical architecture, famous landmarks, renowned hotels and restaurants. Look out for Florida Street, which is fantastic for pedestrians looking for shopping.",,
37,VILLA SOLDATI,,,
38,CONSTITUCION,"Today, Constitución remains a largely immigrant barrio and, with constant reports of squatting, drug wars and open prostitution, it is often classed as the most conflictive barrio in Buenos Aires. Chances are that you will not want to live here; however, you might be interested in passing through briefly one afternoon. If you do have a strong desire to live here then you are all but guaranteed to find cheap rental accommodation although you’ll need to have your wits about you at all times, more so at night when the undesirables come out to play.",,
39,BOEDO,Boedo is traditionally a working class barrio situated in the mid-east area of Buenos Aires Capital Federal. The barrio is known for its influence in tango culture and its cafes were important meeting places for writers and musicians.,,
40,PARQUE PATRICIOS," Today the barrio remains a predominately industrial area, with factories providing residents with jobs. Another attraction is Club Atlético Huracán, a century-old soccer club that competes in the second tier of the Argentine soccer league and plays at the Estadio Tomás A. Ducó. The stadium itself is crumbling but has a welcoming charm, especially for true soccer enthusiasts. Tickets are often easy to come by and can usually be purchased on match days. Conveniently, the 118 bus starts and finishes its route about two blocks from the stadium, providing an easy connection to and from Palermo.",,
41,SAN TELMO,"As one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, San Telmo is full of cobbleston streets, tango performers on weekends especially at tango bars.",,

43,SAN NICOLAS,,,
44,RECOLETA,"An upscale district surrounding the busiest tourist attraction – Recoleta Cemetery. The institution you have to pay attention to here is alive and kicking: la gente-bien of Recoleta, some of them pretty conservative people from families best described as “old money”. The area is busy during office hours, and quieter at night time. If you are fond of tea houses, you can find English bakery all year long. ",,
45,VILLA REAL,,,
46,NUEVA POMPEYA,"Nueva Pompeya portrays a typical working class barrio and its residential zones are characterised by single storey terraced houses. It is also a barrio with a rich tango heritage, a characteristic that owes much to Homero Manzi who frequented the local bars and mentioned the barrio in his song ‘Mano Blanca’.","Gentrification, Working class",
47,PARQUE CHAS,,,
48,PUERTO MADERO,Abandoned warehouses transformed into upscale residential apartments and trendy hotspots. You can spend weekends riding on bikes and indulge in cafes by the river. Because it’s newly renovated,,
