It’s one of the oldest neighborhoods in Buenos Aires, with charming boutiques, fruit stands, restaurants and bars. Owing to its affluence, Belgrano is also popular for shopping. Avenida Cabildo runs the entire width of the barrio and is lined with a huge quantity of clothing and shoe shops ranging from chain stores to independent boutiques.","Affluent, Popular",

Villa Ortúzar has one of the smallest populations within the City of Buenos Aires and is not well known.",,
4,BALVANERA,"In addition to offering a plethora of hotels, hostels and residential accommodation, the barrio has excellent transport links thus within easy reach of the city’s coveted attractions and nightlife hotspots of Palermo and San Telmo.

6,VILLA CRESPO,"Villa Crespo was also sometimes referred to as Palermo Queens around 2007. Palermo is considered a more expensive neighborhood and renaming Villa Crespo as part of Palermo would allow people to charge higher rents, etc. Villa Crespo has been informally associated with Buenos Aires’ Jewish community, with several synagogues located in the barrio. Recently Villa Crespo has started to attract a younger crowd of artistic types, who have given the barrio a distinctly cool edge.",,
7,VILLA GENERAL MITRE,"Villa General Mitre is mainly a residential neighborhood, with wide and quiet streets, some of which are still paved with cobblestones. Avenida Juan B. Justo passes through the center of the neighborhood. Facing the Avenida is the Plaza Sáenz Peña, known for its monument to Norberto Napolitano, a rock singer and resident of the neighborhood.",,

9,PARQUE CHACABUCO,"As it is less popular with tourists and expats, you’ll certainly be able to find some cheaper rents in Parque Chacabuco. Be prepared, however, for a working class neighborhood and nothing like the more Europeanized areas of Palermo.",,
10,PARQUE AVELLANEDA,"Parque Avellaneda is a quiet neighborhood which the dizzying pace of the big city. Buildings from the beginning of the 20th century stand next to modern skyscrapers. There are many green spaces where the tranquil characteristics can be felt. Some of its streets are wide, tree-lined, with little traffic and thus nearly silent, but the Perito Moreno highway does divide the neighborhood into two areas.",,
11,CABALLITO,"You’ll see a quite neighborhood (except for when families pick up or drop off kids at school), where some good old cafes managed to survive next to new cuisines and the Starbucks of the world. You will also find young people in the area, expats and locals, partly because of “Filo” (or “Puan”), one of the University of Buenos Aires buildings. For those who plan to stay a long time in Buenos Aires, the primary attraction of Caballito is that it’s a whole lot cheaper than places like Palermo, very comfortable, has some character, and yet isn’t too far from the action. It’s great value for money.",,

14,VILLA URQUIZA, Villa Urquiza occupies a quieter zone of Buenos Aires with a blend of town houses and modern apartment blocks. If you pass by at the weekend you might just spot locals sweeping the leaves outside their homes and sharing a mate whilst chatting to their neighbors.,,

18,MATADEROS,"There is no better example of working country life within the city confines than Mataderos and when visiting the barrio you will be rewarded with a wonderful insight into how different the city is from the bustle of El Centro and the heavily touristic barrios of Palermo and San Telmo. Great for a visit and to enjoy the spirit of the weekend market, as Mataderos is a solid one-hour bus ride from the main action of the city it is unlikely that you would want to live here for the long-term.",,
19,FLORES,"As it started life as a town in its own right, Flores, with its residential areas, commercial shopping district, nightlife and football club, has just about everything you can ask for and you’ll probably be able to find far cheaper rents than in the barrios further north. The A line of the Subte also stops in the barrio and provides fast access direct to Plaza de Mayo. Close to a slum.",,
20,VERSAILLES,"Versailles has a neighborhood with characteristics of English architecture, due to the large number of immigrants who settled in the neighborhood to work on the railroad.

25,AGRONOMIA,"For those that have a desire to visit a sleepy neighborhood then Agronomía is far removed from commercialism of the ‘cooler’ Buenos Aires barrios. Resembling a spider’s web, there are three-to-four circling streets complete with crisscrossing counterparts which, for the geographically-challenged, can make getting confused a simple thing. Moreover, the circling streets and those leading off them are curiously named after major European cities; Constantinople, La Haya (The Hague) and Sofia, amongst others.",,
26,CHACARITA,"Being just outside of the common Buenos Aires tourist trail, a big plus of staying in Chacarita is its affordability.

32,BARRACAS,"The yellow fever epidemic caused the wealthy residents of Barracas to flee to the northern areas of the city. Just as happened in neighboring San Telmo, the flight of wealthier families from Barracas turned it overnight into a working-class area and provided space for immigrants, particularly from Italy, to find homes there. It has remained a modest, working-class suburb ever since.","Working class, residential",

38,CONSTITUCION,"Today, Constitución remains a largely immigrant barrio and, with constant reports of squatting, drug wars and open prostitution, it is often classed as the most conflictive barrio in Buenos Aires. Chances are that you will not want to live here; however, you might be interested in passing through briefly one afternoon.

44,RECOLETA,"An upscale district surrounding the busiest tourist attraction – Recoleta Cemetery. The institution you have to pay attention to here is alive and kicking: la gente-bien of Recoleta, some of them pretty conservative people from families best described as “old money”.

Like the Villa Devoto neighborhood, old houses contrast beautiful skyscrapers and large gardens influence the building characteristics.
